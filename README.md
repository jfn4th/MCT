Pathfinder Mass Combat Tool
===

A tool to simulate Mass Combat in the Pathfinder RPG.


u need to know the CR of one individual from the unit and the average value of their Hit Dice (d4=2.5, d6=3.5, d8=4.5, d10=5.5, d12=6.5

Determine the Armies size and ACR

Fine   1 CR -8

Diminutive 10 CR -6

Tiny 24 CR -4

Small 50 CR -2

Medium 100 CR

Large 200 CR +2

Huge 500 CR +3

Gargantuan 1000 CR +4

Colossal 2000 CR +6

 

 Determine Hit Points = ACR x Average HP value of 1 Hit Die

 Determine Defense Value = ACR + 10 + Modifiers

 Determine Offensive Modifier = ACR

  

  Variables:

  Battlefield Conditions = Fortifications +16 DV for the Good Guys, Advantageous Terrain +2 DV for the Good Guys

  Tactics = Defensive Wall -2 OM, +2 DV (Dwarves), Relentless Brutality +4 OM, -4 DV (Bad Guys)

  Strategy Track = This is chosen each round of combat and can only go up or down 1 rung each turn

   Defensive +4 DV, -4 OM, -6 Damage

   Cautious +2 DV, -2 OM, -3 Damage

   Standard +0 DV, -0 OM, +0 Damage

   Aggressive -2 DV, +2 OM, +3 Damage

   Reckless -4 DV, +4 OM, +6 Damage


    

	Army Resources = Siege Engines (reduce DV of Fortifications by 1d4 per engine) assume the Bad Guys have 5 siege engines

	Special Abilities = Rock Throwing +4 Damage in Range Phase (Bad Guys)

	 

	 Battle Phases:

	 Tactics Phase = GM applies any battlefield modifiers, Commanders choose tactics
	 Ranged Phase
	 Melee Phase

	  

	  Each Army makes and Offense Check (d20 + OM) and compares it to the other armies DV, if the checks is greater than the DV the army takes the difference in damage (+/- any modifiers)
